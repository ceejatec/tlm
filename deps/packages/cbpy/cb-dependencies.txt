# Our explicit dependencies. Generally use >= to get the latest version,
# unless we need to pin to a specific one.

# Note! Don't list "python" itself here - that has to be specified prior
# to the creation of the environment, so it is defined in CMakeLists.txt.

# We have to lock cryptography to < 39.0 because they removed an API
# that is used by the urllib3.contrib.pyopenssl module that is vendored
# inside of requests. See MB-57219.
